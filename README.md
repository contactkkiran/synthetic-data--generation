# 📘 Synthetic Data Generation – Basics (TypeScript + Faker + Fetch)

This document explains the **fundamentals of synthetic data generation** for automated testing.  
It covers what synthetic data is, why it is needed, the tools required, and how to generate
**dynamic (non-hardcoded)** data for **API** and **GUI** test automation.

This is the foundation for building advanced Data Factories later.

---

## 🚀 What Is Synthetic Data?

Synthetic data is **fake but realistic test data** generated automatically
instead of hardcoding values like:

- “Kiran”
- “test123”
- “demo@gmail.com”
- “9999999999”

The goal is to generate **unique, valid, realistic** test data every time tests run.

---

## 🎯 Why Use Synthetic Data?

| Hardcoded Test Data ❌ | Synthetic Data ✔ |
|------------------------|------------------|
| Repeated values        | Fresh values every run |
| Frequent conflicts     | Unique emails/usernames |
| Low coverage           | High variety of cases |
| Manual updates         | Auto-generated |
| Not production-like    | Realistic names, phones, addresses |
| Poor scalability       | Tens, hundreds, or thousands of records |

Synthetic data is safer, cleaner, and far more scalable.

## 🧩 What You Need for Synthetic Data Generation

To generate synthetic data in a TypeScript project, you need:

### 1️⃣ **A Data Generation Library**
- We use **@faker-js/faker**
- It generates:
  - Names  
  - Emails  
  - Phone numbers  
  - Addresses  
  - Usernames  
  - Passwords  
  - Dates  
  - IDs  
  - Domain-specific fields  

### 2️⃣ **A Runtime Environment**
- Node.js + TypeScript + ts-node

### 3️⃣ **A Dynamic Data Builder Function**
A dedicated function that returns JSON with **fresh dynamic values** every time.

---

## 🔄 Steps to Generate Synthetic Data (Conceptual)

### **STEP 1 — Install Faker**
Add a data generator to your project.

### **STEP 2 — Create a Data Generator Function**
Build a function that returns a JSON object with dynamic values using Faker fields
(names, emails, addresses, passwords, etc.).

### **STEP 3 — Use This JSON in Your Tests**
You now have dynamic test data that can be used for:

#### ➤ API Tests  
Send the generated JSON as:
- POST request body  
- PUT request body  
- PATCH request body  

#### ➤ GUI (UI) Tests  
Fill input fields using:
- user.firstName  
- user.email  
- user.password  
- user.address  

### **STEP 4 — Optional: Save Generated Data**
For multi-step test flows, save the synthetic JSON to:
- `.json` files  
- environment variables  
- in-memory storage  

### **STEP 5 — Extend as Needed**
You can grow the synthetic model to include:

- Orders  
- Products  
- Payments  
- Transactions  
- Policies  
- Bank accounts  
- Invoices  
- Nested objects or arrays  

This becomes a **Data Factory** for the entire project.

## 🧪 How Synthetic Data Helps in Testing

### ✔ Clean and reusable tests  
### ✔ Avoids duplicates (unique emails/usernames)  
### ✔ Works for both API and GUI  
### ✔ Enables negative test generation  
### ✔ Makes CI/CD execution stable  
### ✔ 50+ scenarios possible with dynamic inputs  

---

## 📝 Summary

Synthetic data removes all hardcoded values from your tests and replaces them with **realistic, dynamic JSON** generated at runtime.

With TypeScript + Faker + Fetch:

- You generate fresh JSON data  
- You use that JSON in REST API calls  
- You reuse the same JSON for UI test input  
- You achieve stable, scalable, production-like automation  

This README covers the **basic foundation**.  
In the future, this can be extended into a complete **Test Data Factory** for your project.
